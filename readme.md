### Comments on process

Originally chose to use [this boilerplate](https://github.com/alexdevero/express-react-webapp-boilerplate) as base scaffolding and used my own past work to inform technical approach to server.


Adapted from a task set by another company (requested features in TVC spec were very similar).


Not designed for production use. Only intended for use in local environment.


Tasks remaining to be completed listed in repo [issue queue](https://github.com/pau1m/fullstack-test/issues)
